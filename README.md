# voice_recognition

This is a speech recognition project.

The project contains the following files:
- html file
- css file
- js file --> to creat the voise recognition 
- php file --> to send data
- images file --> containes: screen recording of how the project works , screenshots for the text saved in the database and the project page


It was built using javascript speech recognition methods (window.SpeechRecognition and window.webkitSpeechRecognition) , it is intended to save in the database what the users are saying and also show the users what they sayed.

With the help of FormData object in js i was able to send data from the js file to the php file and then save them in the database.
the database has two columns, first is id column it is just to know how many texts are sent (it is incremental) , the second column is to save the text (type is text)

HTML and CSS files were used to give the project the appearance that users view when they access the page. To give the project a nice feeling, image of mic ðŸŽ¤  and text animations were used.
